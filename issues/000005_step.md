# Step 000005: Enhanced Search Result Data Structures

## Overview
Create rich, structured data classes to replace simple tuples in search results, providing the foundation for enhanced MCP integration.

## Context
Currently, search results are returned as simple tuples `(file_path, snippet, distance_score)`. We need structured data objects that can carry rich metadata and support complex AI reasoning.

## Implementation Tasks

### 1. Core Data Classes
- Create `search_result_types.py` module with dataclasses:
  - `CodeSnippet` - represents a code fragment with line numbers and context
  - `CodeSearchResult` - comprehensive search result with metadata
  - `SearchMetadata` - overall search execution information

### 2. Basic Result Enhancement
- Update `search_operations.py` to return `CodeSearchResult` objects instead of tuples
- Include file metadata (language, type, size) in results
- Add confidence scoring and match reasoning
- Implement relative path calculation for cleaner display

### 3. Snippet Improvement
- Replace simple string truncation with intelligent snippet extraction
- Show complete logical units (functions, classes) when possible
- Include line number references for IDE navigation
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing string-based tools

### 4. Integration Layer
- Create adapter functions to convert between new objects and legacy tuple format
- Ensure existing MCP tools continue to work during transition
- Add JSON serialization support for structured data

## Success Criteria
- [x] Search operations return structured `CodeSearchResult` objects
- [x] Results include rich metadata (file type, language, size, line numbers)
- [x] Existing MCP tools continue to function without modification
- [x] New data structures are properly serializable for API responses

## Files to Create/Modify
- `search_result_types.py` - New module with data classes
- `search_operations.py` - Update to return structured results
- `mcp_server.py` - Add compatibility adapter functions
- `tests/test_search_result_types.py` - Test data structures

## Dependencies
- Step 000004 must be completed (metadata extraction)

## Technical Notes
- Use Python dataclasses with type hints for clean, maintainable code
- Implement `__str__` methods for backward compatibility
- Consider using Pydantic for advanced validation and serialization
- Design for extensibility - new metadata fields should be easy to add

## Estimated Effort
3-4 hours

## Proposed Solution

After analyzing the current implementation, I propose the following approach:

### Phase 1: Create Data Structure Foundation
1. **Create `search_result_types.py`** with three core dataclasses:
   - `CodeSnippet`: Contains text, start_line, end_line, and context information
   - `CodeSearchResult`: Contains file_path, snippet, similarity_score, file_metadata (language, size, type), and confidence level
   - `SearchMetadata`: Contains search execution info, timing, and result statistics

2. **Key Design Principles**:
   - Use Python dataclasses with type hints for clarity
   - Implement `__str__` methods that return the same format as current tuples for backward compatibility
   - Add `to_dict()` methods for JSON serialization
   - Include `from_tuple()` class methods to convert from legacy format

### Phase 2: Enhanced Snippet Extraction
1. **Intelligent Snippet Logic**:
   - For Python files: Extract complete functions/classes when match is within one
   - For other files: Use smart truncation that avoids cutting mid-word
   - Include line numbers and relative path calculation
   - Maintain 200-character fallback for compatibility

### Phase 3: Gradual Migration
1. **Update `search_operations.py`**:
   - Modify `search_index()` to return `List[CodeSearchResult]`
   - Add file type detection and metadata enrichment
   - Keep distance-to-similarity conversion logic

2. **Adapter Layer in `mcp_server.py`**:
   - Add `result_to_tuple()` function for legacy compatibility
   - Create `format_structured_results()` for enhanced display
   - Gradually migrate MCP tools to use structured format

### Phase 4: Testing & Validation
1. **Comprehensive Test Coverage**:
   - Unit tests for all dataclasses and their methods  
   - Integration tests ensuring backward compatibility
   - Performance tests to ensure no regression

This approach ensures zero breaking changes while laying foundation for future enhancements.
