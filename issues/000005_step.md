# Step 000005: Enhanced Search Result Data Structures

## Overview
Create rich, structured data classes to replace simple tuples in search results, providing the foundation for enhanced MCP integration.

## Context
Currently, search results are returned as simple tuples `(file_path, snippet, distance_score)`. We need structured data objects that can carry rich metadata and support complex AI reasoning.

## Implementation Tasks

### 1. Core Data Classes
- Create `search_result_types.py` module with dataclasses:
  - `CodeSnippet` - represents a code fragment with line numbers and context
  - `CodeSearchResult` - comprehensive search result with metadata
  - `SearchMetadata` - overall search execution information

### 2. Basic Result Enhancement
- Update `search_operations.py` to return `CodeSearchResult` objects instead of tuples
- Include file metadata (language, type, size) in results
- Add confidence scoring and match reasoning
- Implement relative path calculation for cleaner display

### 3. Snippet Improvement
- Replace simple string truncation with intelligent snippet extraction
- Show complete logical units (functions, classes) when possible
- Include line number references for IDE navigation
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing string-based tools

### 4. Integration Layer
- Create adapter functions to convert between new objects and legacy tuple format
- Ensure existing MCP tools continue to work during transition
- Add JSON serialization support for structured data

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Search operations return structured `CodeSearchResult` objects
- [ ] Results include rich metadata (file type, language, size, line numbers)
- [ ] Existing MCP tools continue to function without modification
- [ ] New data structures are properly serializable for API responses

## Files to Create/Modify
- `search_result_types.py` - New module with data classes
- `search_operations.py` - Update to return structured results
- `mcp_server.py` - Add compatibility adapter functions
- `tests/test_search_result_types.py` - Test data structures

## Dependencies
- Step 000004 must be completed (metadata extraction)

## Technical Notes
- Use Python dataclasses with type hints for clean, maintainable code
- Implement `__str__` methods for backward compatibility
- Consider using Pydantic for advanced validation and serialization
- Design for extensibility - new metadata fields should be easy to add
