# Step 000013: Search Result Caching and Performance Optimization

## Overview
Implement intelligent caching and performance optimizations to handle the increased complexity of enhanced search results while maintaining fast response times.

## Context
With rich metadata, construct-level search, and advanced ranking, search operations have become more complex. We need caching and optimization to maintain the fast performance that makes the tool useful.

## Implementation Tasks

### 1. Multi-Level Caching System
- Create `search_cache.py` module
- Implement query result caching with TTL expiration
- Add embedding caching to avoid regenerating query embeddings
- Cache construct metadata and file metadata separately
- Use LRU eviction for memory-bounded caches

### 2. Database Query Optimization
- Add strategic database indexes for new metadata columns
- Optimize JOIN queries between `code_files` and `code_constructs`
- Implement query result pagination for large result sets
- Add database connection pooling for concurrent searches

### 3. Incremental Search Features
- Implement search-as-you-type with result streaming
- Add incremental result refinement (narrow down existing results)
- Cache intermediate search states for faster refinement
- Support search continuation (get next page of results)

### 4. Performance Monitoring and Metrics
- Add timing instrumentation throughout the search pipeline
- Track cache hit/miss ratios and performance impact
- Monitor database query performance and slow queries
- Implement performance regression testing

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Search response times remain under 500ms for typical queries
- [ ] Cache hit ratio is above 60% for repeated searches
- [ ] Database queries are properly indexed and optimized
- [ ] Large result sets are handled efficiently with pagination
- [ ] Performance monitoring provides actionable insights

## Files to Create/Modify
- `search_cache.py` - New module for caching infrastructure
- `search_operations.py` - Add caching to search operations
- `database_manager.py` - Add performance optimizations
- `performance_monitor.py` - New module for performance tracking
- `tests/test_search_performance.py` - Performance regression tests

## Dependencies
- Step 000012 must be completed (IDE integration foundation)

## Technical Notes
- Use `functools.lru_cache` for simple function result caching
- Consider Redis for distributed caching in future versions
- Balance cache memory usage with performance benefits
- Implement cache invalidation when index is updated

## Estimated Effort
