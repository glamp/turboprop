# Step 000018: Documentation and Migration Guide

## Overview
Create comprehensive documentation for the enhanced search functionality and provide migration guides for users upgrading from the basic tuple-based system.

## Context
The enhanced search system introduces significant new capabilities and data structures. Clear documentation and migration paths are essential for user adoption and maintainability.

## Implementation Tasks

### 1. API Documentation
- Document all new data structures and their usage
- Create comprehensive MCP tool documentation with examples
- Document configuration options and their effects
- Add troubleshooting guides for common issues

### 2. Migration Guide
- Create step-by-step migration guide from basic to enhanced search
- Document backward compatibility considerations
- Provide example code for upgrading existing integrations
- Add database migration instructions and rollback procedures

### 3. Developer Guide
- Document the enhanced search architecture and design decisions
- Create extension guide for adding new languages or features
- Document performance tuning and optimization options
- Add contribution guidelines for community developers

### 4. User Guide
- Create user-facing documentation for search improvements
- Document new search capabilities and how to use them effectively
- Add best practices for writing effective search queries
- Create video tutorials or interactive demos

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All new APIs are documented with clear examples
- [ ] Migration path is clear and tested with real user scenarios
- [ ] Documentation is comprehensive but not overwhelming
- [ ] Search improvements are clearly explained to end users

## Files to Create/Modify
