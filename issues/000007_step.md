# Step 000007: Code Constructs Extraction and Indexing

## Overview
Create a new `code_constructs` table to store extracted programming constructs (functions, classes, variables) with their own embeddings for more granular search capabilities.

## Context
While file-level search is useful, developers often need to find specific functions or classes. By extracting and indexing individual code constructs, we can provide much more precise search results.

## Implementation Tasks

### 1. Database Schema Creation
- Create the `code_constructs` table as specified in the design
- Add indexes for efficient querying by construct type and file relationships
- Implement foreign key relationships to the `code_files` table
- Add migration logic to create the table in existing databases

### 2. AST-Based Code Extraction
- Create `code_construct_extractor.py` module
- Implement construct extraction for Python:
  - Functions (with parameters, return types, docstrings)
  - Classes (with inheritance, methods)
  - Global variables and constants
  - Import statements
- Add support for JavaScript/TypeScript:
  - Functions and arrow functions
  - Classes and prototypes
  - Exports and imports
  - Interface definitions (TypeScript)

### 3. Construct Embedding Generation
- Generate separate embeddings for each extracted construct
- Use construct signature + docstring + surrounding context for embedding
- Store construct embeddings in the new table alongside metadata
- Optimize embedding generation to avoid redundant processing

### 4. Integration with Indexing Pipeline
- Update indexing operations to extract and store constructs
- Ensure construct extraction happens after file metadata extraction
- Add progress tracking for construct processing
- Handle parse errors gracefully without breaking indexing

## Success Criteria
- [ ] `code_constructs` table is created and properly indexed
- [ ] Functions and classes are extracted from Python files with accurate metadata
- [ ] Each construct has its own embedding for semantic search
- [ ] Construct extraction integrates smoothly with existing indexing process
- [ ] Database relationships are properly maintained

## Files to Create/Modify
- `code_construct_extractor.py` - New module for AST-based extraction
- `database_manager.py` - Add construct table creation and migration
- `indexing_operations.py` - Integrate construct extraction
- `tests/test_construct_extraction.py` - Test extraction accuracy

## Dependencies
- Step 000006 must be completed (snippet extraction foundation)

## Technical Notes
- Use Python's built-in `ast` module for Python parsing
- Consider using `typescript` npm package via subprocess for TS parsing
- Store construct signatures in a normalized format for consistent searching
- Balance extraction depth vs. performance - focus on most commonly searched constructs

## Estimated Effort
8-10 hours

## Proposed Solution

Based on my analysis of the current codebase architecture, I will implement the code constructs extraction and indexing feature in the following phases:

### Phase 1: Database Schema Enhancement
1. **Create `code_constructs` table**: Add schema definition with foreign key relationship to `code_files`
2. **Implement migration logic**: Extend `database_manager.py` to handle the new table creation
3. **Add indexing**: Create indexes for efficient querying by construct type and file relationships

### Phase 2: AST-Based Code Extraction Module  
1. **Create `code_construct_extractor.py`**: New module following the existing patterns from `snippet_extractor.py`
2. **Implement Python extraction**: Use Python's `ast` module to extract:
   - Functions (with parameters, return types, docstrings) 
   - Classes (with inheritance, methods)
   - Global variables and constants
   - Import statements
3. **Implement JavaScript/TypeScript extraction**: Use regex patterns and brace balancing from existing JS extractor to extract:
   - Functions and arrow functions
   - Classes and prototypes  
   - Exports and imports
   - Interface definitions (TypeScript)

### Phase 3: Construct Embedding Integration
1. **Generate construct embeddings**: Create embeddings using construct signature + docstring + context
2. **Store constructs with metadata**: Save to `code_constructs` table with proper relationships
3. **Optimize embedding generation**: Avoid redundant processing and batch operations

### Phase 4: Pipeline Integration
1. **Update indexing operations**: Modify `indexing_operations.py` to call construct extraction after file processing
2. **Add progress tracking**: Integrate with existing tqdm progress bars
3. **Error handling**: Gracefully handle parse errors without breaking indexing
4. **Maintain database consistency**: Ensure construct cleanup when files are removed

### Implementation Strategy
- **Follow existing patterns**: Leverage the architecture already established in `snippet_extractor.py` and `language_detection.py`  
- **Use Test Driven Development**: Write tests first, then implement functionality
- **Maintain backward compatibility**: Ensure existing functionality continues to work
- **Incremental integration**: Add construct extraction as an optional step that doesn't break current workflows

### Database Schema Design
```sql
CREATE TABLE code_constructs (
    id VARCHAR PRIMARY KEY,           -- SHA-256 hash of file_id + construct signature
    file_id VARCHAR NOT NULL,         -- Foreign key to code_files.id  
    construct_type VARCHAR NOT NULL,  -- 'function', 'class', 'variable', 'import'
    name VARCHAR NOT NULL,            -- Name of the construct
    start_line INTEGER NOT NULL,      -- Starting line number
    end_line INTEGER NOT NULL,        -- Ending line number  
    signature TEXT,                   -- Function/class signature
    docstring TEXT,                   -- Associated documentation
    parent_construct_id VARCHAR,      -- For nested constructs (methods in classes)
    embedding DOUBLE[384],            -- Semantic embedding vector
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE INDEX idx_code_constructs_file_id ON code_constructs(file_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_code_constructs_type ON code_constructs(construct_type);
CREATE INDEX idx_code_constructs_name ON code_constructs(name);
```
