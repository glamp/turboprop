# Step 000014: Search Query Analysis and Suggestions

## Overview
Implement intelligent query analysis and suggestion generation to help users refine their searches and discover related code more effectively.

## Context
With enhanced search capabilities, we can now provide intelligent query suggestions, detect query intent, and guide users toward more effective searches based on repository content and search patterns.

## Implementation Tasks

### 1. Query Intent Detection
- Create `query_analyzer.py` module
- Implement query classification:
  - Code construct searches ("find function that...", "class for...")
  - File type searches ("Python script", "React component")
  - Functionality searches ("authentication", "database connection")
  - Pattern searches ("error handling", "API endpoint")

### 2. Query Suggestion Engine
- Generate search refinement suggestions based on current results
- Suggest related queries based on repository content
- Recommend alternative search terms for low-result queries
- Provide search tips based on query patterns

### 3. Repository-Aware Suggestions
- Analyze repository content to suggest domain-specific searches
- Use project dependencies to suggest relevant technology searches
- Leverage git history to suggest recently modified code searches
- Consider file organization patterns for navigation suggestions

### 4. Search History and Learning
- Track successful search patterns (without storing sensitive queries)
- Learn from search refinement patterns
- Suggest similar searches based on anonymous usage patterns
- Implement search bookmarking and saved searches

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Query intent is correctly classified for common search types
- [ ] Suggestions improve search success rate and user experience
- [ ] Repository-specific suggestions are relevant and helpful
- [ ] Search suggestions respect user privacy and don't store sensitive data

## Files to Create/Modify
- `query_analyzer.py` - New module for query analysis and suggestions
- `mcp_server.py` - Include suggestions in MCP responses
- `search_operations.py` - Add suggestion generation to search pipeline
- `tests/test_query_analysis.py` - Test query classification and suggestions

## Dependencies
- Step 000013 must be completed (performance optimization foundation)

## Technical Notes
- Use keyword extraction and NLP techniques for query analysis
- Keep suggestion generation fast to avoid slowing down search
- Consider using repository-specific vocabularies for better suggestions
- Balance suggestion helpfulness with user privacy concerns

## Estimated Effort
4-5 hours
