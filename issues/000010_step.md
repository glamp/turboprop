# Step 000010: Repository Context and Git Integration

## Overview
Implement the `repository_context` table and git integration features to provide project-wide context and version control information for better code understanding.

## Context
Code understanding often requires repository context - knowing the project type, dependencies, git history, and current branch. This information helps AI agents make better suggestions and understand code relationships.

## Implementation Tasks

### 1. Repository Context Schema
- Create the `repository_context` table as specified in the design
- Store git repository information (branch, commit hash, remote URLs)
- Extract and store project type and dependency information
- Track indexing metadata (when indexed, by whom, etc.)

### 2. Git Information Extraction
- Create `git_integration.py` module
- Extract current branch, commit hash, and remote repository information
- Detect repository root and handle submodules appropriately
- Handle non-git directories gracefully (fallback to directory-based context)

### 3. Project Type Detection
- Implement project type detection based on files and structure:
  - Python (setup.py, pyproject.toml, requirements.txt)
  - JavaScript/Node.js (package.json, package-lock.json)
  - Java (pom.xml, build.gradle)
  - Go (go.mod, go.sum)
  - Rust (Cargo.toml, Cargo.lock)

### 4. Dependency Extraction
- Parse common dependency files and extract dependency lists
- Store dependencies as JSON arrays for flexible querying
- Include version information where available
- Handle multiple dependency files in the same project

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Repository context is automatically detected and stored during indexing
- [ ] Git information (branch, commit) is accurately captured
- [ ] Project type is correctly identified for common frameworks
- [ ] Dependencies are extracted from standard files (package.json, requirements.txt, etc.)
- [ ] Repository context is available in search results and MCP responses

## Files to Create/Modify
- `git_integration.py` - New module for git and project detection
- `database_manager.py` - Add repository_context table creation
- `indexing_operations.py` - Integrate repository context extraction
- `search_result_types.py` - Include repository context in results
- `tests/test_git_integration.py` - Test git detection and project analysis

## Dependencies
- Step 000009 must be completed (construct-level search foundation)

## Technical Notes
- Use subprocess to call git commands for repository information
- Parse dependency files with appropriate libraries (json for package.json, toml for pyproject.toml)
- Store repository context once per repository, not per file
- Handle git repositories with multiple worktrees or submodules
