# Step 000015: Cross-Reference and Relationship Mapping

## Overview
Implement code relationship tracking and cross-reference analysis to help developers understand how code components interact and depend on each other.

## Context
Understanding code relationships (imports, function calls, inheritance) is crucial for effective code navigation and modification. This step adds relationship mapping to provide better context for search results.

## Implementation Tasks

### 1. Import and Dependency Tracking
- Create `relationship_mapper.py` module
- Track import relationships between files and modules
- Map external dependencies to internal code usage
- Detect circular dependencies and import patterns
- Store relationships in a new `code_relationships` table

### 2. Function Call Analysis
- Implement basic call graph analysis for Python and JavaScript
- Track which functions call which other functions
- Identify commonly used utility functions and libraries
- Map API usage patterns across the codebase

### 3. Inheritance and Type Relationships  
- Track class inheritance hierarchies
- Map interface implementations (TypeScript, Java)
- Identify common base classes and utility types
- Track method overrides and implementations

### 4. Cross-Reference Integration
- Include related code in search results
- Show "Used by" and "Uses" information for functions and classes
- Suggest related searches based on code relationships
- Add relationship visualization data for IDE plugins

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Import relationships are accurately tracked for Python and JavaScript
- [ ] Cross-references are included in search results where relevant
- [ ] Relationship data enhances code understanding without overwhelming results
- [ ] Call graph analysis provides useful insights into code usage patterns

## Files to Create/Modify
- `relationship_mapper.py` - New module for relationship analysis
- `database_manager.py` - Add code_relationships table
- `search_result_types.py` - Include relationship data in results
- `indexing_operations.py` - Integrate relationship extraction
- `tests/test_relationship_mapping.py` - Test relationship accuracy

## Dependencies
- Step 000014 must be completed (query analysis foundation)

## Technical Notes
- Use AST analysis to extract function calls and imports
- Store relationships in a normalized format for efficient querying
- Consider using graph databases for complex relationship queries in future
- Balance relationship depth with performance and usefulness
