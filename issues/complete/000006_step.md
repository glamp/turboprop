# Step 000006: Intelligent Snippet Extraction

## Overview
Implement context-aware code snippet extraction that shows complete logical units (functions, classes) instead of arbitrary character truncations.

## Context
The current system shows the first 300 characters of files, which often cuts off mid-sentence or mid-function. For optimal AI agent understanding, we need snippets that respect code boundaries and provide meaningful context.

## Implementation Tasks

### 1. Language-Aware Parsing
- Create `snippet_extractor.py` module
- Implement basic AST parsing for major languages:
  - Python: functions, classes, imports
  - JavaScript/TypeScript: functions, classes, exports
  - Java: methods, classes, packages
  - Go: functions, structs, packages

### 2. Intelligent Boundary Detection
- Find the complete function/class containing the matched content
- Extract meaningful imports and dependencies
- Handle edge cases (global variables, module-level code)
- Fall back to line-based extraction for unsupported languages

### 3. Multi-Snippet Support
- Extract multiple relevant code sections from the same file
- Rank snippets by relevance to the search query
- Ensure snippets don't overlap or duplicate information
- Limit total snippet size while maximizing context

### 4. Line Number Integration
- Include precise line number references for IDE navigation
- Track start and end lines for each extracted snippet
- Support `file:line` URL format for direct IDE opening
- Maintain snippet context even with line number changes

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Snippets show complete functions/classes instead of arbitrary truncations
- [ ] Line numbers accurately reflect snippet boundaries
- [ ] Multiple relevant snippets are extracted from the same file when appropriate
- [ ] Extraction works for Python, JavaScript, and at least one other language
- [ ] Graceful fallback for unsupported languages or parsing errors

## Files to Create/Modify
- `snippet_extractor.py` - New module for intelligent extraction
- `search_operations.py` - Integrate snippet extraction into search
- `search_result_types.py` - Update data classes to support multi-snippet results
- `tests/test_snippet_extraction.py` - Test extraction accuracy

## Dependencies
- Step 000005 must be completed (search result data structures)

## Technical Notes
- Use language-specific AST libraries (ast for Python, acorn for JS, etc.)
- Consider using Tree-sitter for unified parsing across languages
- Balance snippet size vs. context - aim for 10-50 lines of meaningful code
- Handle syntax errors gracefully with fallback extraction

## Estimated Effort
6-8 hours

## Proposed Solution

After analyzing the current implementation, I propose the following comprehensive approach:

### Phase 1: Core Snippet Extractor Module
1. **Create `snippet_extractor.py`** with language-aware AST parsing:
   - Use Python's `ast` module for Python code
   - Use `acorn` or simple regex patterns for JavaScript/TypeScript
   - Use basic regex patterns for Go, Java, and other languages
   - Implement graceful fallback to line-based extraction for unsupported languages

2. **Key Classes**:
   - `SnippetExtractor`: Main orchestrator that detects language and delegates to appropriate parser
   - `PythonSnippetExtractor`: Uses Python AST to find complete functions/classes
   - `JavaScriptSnippetExtractor`: Uses regex patterns to identify function boundaries
   - `GenericSnippetExtractor`: Fallback that uses intelligent line-based extraction

### Phase 2: Multi-Snippet Support
1. **Enhanced Data Structures**:
   - Extend existing `CodeSnippet` class to support context snippets
   - Add `relevance_score` field to rank multiple snippets from the same file
   - Update `CodeSearchResult` to hold multiple `CodeSnippet` objects when beneficial

2. **Relevance Ranking**:
   - Use substring matching for direct query matches in function names
   - Prioritize complete functions/classes over partial matches
   - Limit total snippet size while maximizing contextual value

### Phase 3: Intelligent Boundary Detection
1. **Python-specific Logic**:
   - Extract complete function definitions (def + docstring + body)
   - Extract class definitions with relevant methods
   - Include necessary imports at the top of snippets
   - Handle nested functions and classes appropriately

2. **JavaScript/TypeScript Logic**:
   - Detect function declarations and arrow functions
   - Extract complete class definitions
   - Include relevant import/require statements
   - Handle module exports and destructuring patterns

3. **Generic Language Support**:
   - Use indentation-based boundary detection for Python-like languages
   - Use brace-based boundary detection for C-style languages
   - Fall back to smart line truncation for unsupported formats

### Phase 4: Integration and Enhancement
1. **Update `search_operations.py`**:
   - Replace `_create_enhanced_snippet()` with calls to `SnippetExtractor`
   - Maintain backward compatibility with existing snippet length limits
   - Add multi-snippet aggregation logic when multiple relevant sections found

2. **Line Number Precision**:
   - Ensure accurate line number tracking for extracted boundaries
   - Support `file:line` URL format for IDE integration
   - Handle line number shifts during snippet combination

### Phase 5: Testing and Validation
1. **Comprehensive Test Suite**:
   - Unit tests for each language-specific extractor
   - Integration tests with real codebases (using existing example-codebases)
   - Performance tests to ensure no regression in search speed
   - Edge case testing (syntax errors, incomplete files, very large functions)

### Technical Implementation Details

**Leveraging Existing Infrastructure**:
- Use existing `LanguageDetector` class for consistent language identification
- Build on existing `CodeSnippet` and `CodeSearchResult` classes from Step 000005  
- Maintain compatibility with current configuration system for snippet length limits

**Smart Extraction Algorithm**:
1. Detect file language using existing `language_detection.py`
2. Parse content using appropriate language-specific extractor
3. Find AST nodes or text boundaries containing search matches
4. Extract complete logical units (functions/classes) when possible
5. Include relevant context (imports, adjacent functions)
6. Rank and limit snippets by relevance and total size
7. Fall back to intelligent truncation for unparseable content

**Performance Considerations**:
- Cache parsed ASTs for files during batch operations  
- Implement lazy evaluation for multi-snippet extraction
- Use configurable limits to prevent excessive snippet generation
- Maintain sub-200ms extraction time for typical code files

This approach ensures backward compatibility while providing significantly enhanced context for AI agents to understand and reason about code structure.
