# Step 000012: IDE Navigation and Integration Features

## Overview
Implement IDE-friendly navigation features including file:line URLs, syntax highlighting hints, and integration helpers for seamless development workflow.

## Context
For optimal Claude Code integration, search results should provide direct navigation to code locations in IDEs, with helpful metadata for syntax highlighting and context understanding.

## Implementation Tasks

### 1. IDE Navigation URL Generation
- Create `ide_integration.py` module
- Generate standardized `file:///path/to/file:line` URLs
- Support multiple URL schemes for different IDEs:
  - VS Code: `vscode://file/path:line:column`
  - JetBrains IDEs: `idea://open?file=path&line=line`
  - Vim/Neovim: `nvim://path:line`
- Include both absolute and relative path variants

### 2. Syntax Highlighting Metadata
- Add language-specific syntax highlighting hints to results
- Include token types and positions for key constructs
- Provide theme-agnostic highlighting information
- Support common highlighting formats (TextMate, Prism.js, etc.)

### 3. Context Integration Features
- Generate "Open in IDE" actions for MCP results
- Create jump-to-definition links for imported modules
- Add "Show related files" functionality
- Implement "Find usages" suggestions for functions and classes

### 4. Cross-Platform Compatibility
- Handle Windows, macOS, and Linux path differences
- Support WSL path translation for Windows users
- Handle network drives and symbolic links appropriately
- Provide fallback options when IDE detection fails

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Search results include working IDE navigation URLs
- [ ] URLs open correctly in VS Code, JetBrains IDEs, and at least one other editor
- [ ] Syntax highlighting metadata is provided for major languages
- [ ] Cross-platform path handling works correctly
- [ ] Integration features enhance developer workflow without adding complexity

## Files to Create/Modify
- `ide_integration.py` - New module for IDE navigation and integration
- `search_result_types.py` - Add IDE navigation fields to results
- `mcp_server.py` - Include IDE integration in MCP responses
- `tests/test_ide_integration.py` - Test URL generation and path handling

## Dependencies
- Step 000011 must be completed (result ranking foundation)

## Technical Notes
- Use `pathlib` for cross-platform path handling
- Detect IDE availability through process lists or config files
- Cache IDE detection results for better performance
- Consider supporting custom URL schemes via configuration

## Estimated Effort
4-5 hours
