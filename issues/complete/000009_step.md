# Step 000009: Construct-Level Semantic Search

## Overview
Implement semantic search over individual code constructs (functions, classes) to provide more granular and precise search results.

## Context
With code constructs now extracted and indexed (Step 000007), we can search at the function/class level rather than just file level, providing much more precise results for developers.

## Implementation Tasks

### 1. Construct Search Operations
- Create `construct_search.py` module
- Implement semantic search over the `code_constructs` table
- Add construct-specific ranking algorithms
- Support filtering by construct type (functions only, classes only, etc.)

### 2. Hybrid Search Implementation
- Combine file-level and construct-level results intelligently
- Implement result merging and deduplication
- Add construct context to file-level results when available
- Rank results based on both file and construct relevance

### 3. Specialized Search Tools
- Create MCP tools for construct-specific searches:
  - `search_functions` - find functions by description
  - `search_classes` - find classes and their methods
  - `search_imports` - find import patterns and dependencies
- Add construct filtering options to main search tools

### 4. Enhanced Result Context
- Include construct signatures and docstrings in results
- Show related constructs from the same file
- Add call graph information where available
- Provide construct usage examples and patterns

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Construct-level search returns more precise results than file-level search
- [ ] Hybrid search effectively combines file and construct results
- [ ] Specialized search tools work for functions, classes, and imports
- [ ] Results include rich construct metadata and context
- [ ] Search performance is acceptable with the additional construct data

## Files to Create/Modify
- `construct_search.py` - New module for construct-level search
- `search_operations.py` - Add hybrid search capabilities
- `mcp_server.py` - Add specialized construct search tools
- `tests/test_construct_search.py` - Test construct search accuracy

## Dependencies
- Step 000007 must be completed (code constructs extraction)
- Step 000008 must be completed (structured responses)

## Technical Notes
- Use separate vector searches on constructs and files, then merge results
- Weight construct matches higher than file matches for precision
- Consider caching construct embeddings for faster repeated searches
- Handle cases where constructs are more relevant than their containing files

## Estimated Effort
6-7 hours

## Proposed Solution

Based on my analysis of the current codebase, I will implement construct-level semantic search through the following approach:

### Phase 1: Core Construct Search Module
1. **Create `construct_search.py`**: Implement dedicated construct search functions that query the existing `code_constructs` table with semantic embeddings
2. **Construct-specific ranking**: Weight results based on construct type, signature complexity, and docstring quality
3. **Filtering capabilities**: Support filtering by construct type (functions, classes, methods, imports) and file relationships

### Phase 2: Hybrid Search Integration
1. **Extend `search_operations.py`**: Add hybrid search functions that combine file-level and construct-level results
2. **Intelligent result merging**: Merge and deduplicate results, prioritizing construct matches when more relevant
3. **Enhanced context**: Include construct metadata and relationships in search results

### Phase 3: Specialized MCP Tools
1. **Add construct-specific MCP tools**: 
   - `search_functions` - find functions by description and signature
   - `search_classes` - find classes and their methods 
   - `search_imports` - find import patterns and dependencies
2. **Rich result formatting**: Include construct signatures, docstrings, and usage context
3. **Cross-references**: Show related constructs from the same files

### Phase 4: Comprehensive Testing
1. **Create `test_construct_search.py`**: Test construct search accuracy and performance
2. **Test hybrid search**: Verify intelligent merging and ranking of file vs construct results
3. **Test MCP tool integration**: Ensure specialized tools work correctly with structured responses

### Implementation Strategy
- **Leverage existing architecture**: Use the established `code_constructs` table and embedding infrastructure
- **Follow TDD approach**: Write tests first, then implement functionality
- **Maintain backward compatibility**: Ensure existing search functionality continues to work
- **Build incrementally**: Add construct search as enhancement to existing capabilities
