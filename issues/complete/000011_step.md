# Step 000011: Advanced Result Ranking and Confidence Scoring

## Overview
Implement sophisticated result ranking algorithms and confidence scoring to improve search result quality and provide transparency in result relevance.

## Context
With rich metadata now available, we can implement intelligent ranking that considers multiple factors beyond just embedding similarity, providing better results and confidence indicators for AI agents.

## Implementation Tasks

### 1. Multi-Factor Ranking Algorithm
- Create `result_ranking.py` module
- Implement composite scoring that considers:
  - Embedding similarity (base score)
  - File type relevance (prefer source code over docs for code queries)
  - Construct type matching (functions for function queries)
  - File size and complexity (balance detail vs. relevance)
  - Git recency (more recently modified files score higher)

### 2. Confidence Level Classification
- Implement confidence scoring: 'high', 'medium', 'low'
- Base confidence on multiple factors:
  - Embedding similarity threshold
  - Query-result type alignment
  - Construct completeness (full function vs. snippet)
  - Cross-validation with similar results

### 3. Match Reason Generation
- Implement explainable search results
- Generate human-readable reasons for why results match:
  - "Function signature matches query pattern"
  - "Docstring contains relevant keywords"
  - "File contains imported libraries mentioned in query"
  - "Similar code patterns found in same file"

### 4. Result Clustering and Deduplication
- Group similar results from the same file or related files
- Identify and merge duplicate or near-duplicate results
- Implement result diversity to avoid showing too many similar matches
- Add cross-reference detection between related code constructs

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Search results are ranked by composite relevance, not just similarity
- [ ] Each result includes a confidence level (high/medium/low)
- [ ] Results include human-readable explanations for why they match
- [ ] Similar results are properly clustered and deduplicated
- [ ] Result quality is noticeably improved compared to simple similarity ranking

## Files to Create/Modify
- `result_ranking.py` - New module for advanced ranking and scoring
- `search_operations.py` - Integrate advanced ranking into search
- `search_result_types.py` - Add confidence and reasoning fields
- `tests/test_result_ranking.py` - Test ranking algorithm effectiveness

## Dependencies
- Step 000010 must be completed (repository context available)

## Technical Notes
- Use weighted combination of multiple relevance signals
- Consider implementing machine learning-based ranking in future iterations
- Balance ranking sophistication with search performance
- Design ranking to be configurable and tunable

## Proposed Solution

After analyzing the existing codebase, I found that basic confidence scoring is already implemented using similarity thresholds, but the sophisticated multi-factor ranking and explainable search are missing. Here's my implementation plan:

### 1. Multi-Factor Ranking Algorithm (result_ranking.py)
Create a comprehensive ranking system that considers:
- **Embedding similarity** (base score, weight: 0.4)
- **File type relevance** (prefer source code, weight: 0.2)  
- **Construct type matching** (function queries match functions, weight: 0.2)
- **File recency** (Git modification time, weight: 0.1)
- **File size optimization** (balance detail vs relevance, weight: 0.1)

### 2. Enhanced Confidence Classification
Expand beyond similarity thresholds to include:
- **Query-result type alignment** (function query â†’ function result)
- **Construct completeness** (full function vs partial snippet)
- **Cross-validation with similar results** (consistency check)
- **Multi-signal confidence** (combining multiple indicators)

### 3. Match Reason Generation
Implement explainable search with reasons like:
- "Function name matches query keywords"
- "Docstring contains related terminology" 
- "File imports libraries mentioned in query"
- "Similar patterns found in same module"

### 4. Advanced Result Processing
- **Smart deduplication** (merge similar results from same file)
- **Result diversity** (avoid showing too many similar matches)
- **Cross-reference detection** (link related constructs)
- **Contextual clustering** (group by logical relationships)

### Implementation Strategy
1. Build `result_ranking.py` with pluggable ranking components
2. Extend `search_result_types.py` with match reasoning fields
3. Integrate ranking into existing search operations
4. Implement comprehensive TDD test suite
5. Ensure backward compatibility with existing APIs

### Testing Approach
- Unit tests for each ranking component
- Integration tests with real code samples
- Performance benchmarks vs existing search
- A/B testing framework for ranking improvements
