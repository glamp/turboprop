# Step 000008: Structured MCP Tool Responses

## Overview
Replace string-based MCP tool responses with structured JSON data that Claude can process programmatically, while maintaining backward compatibility.

## Context
The current MCP tools return formatted strings that are human-readable but hard for Claude to parse programmatically. We need to provide structured data while maintaining the existing user experience.

## Implementation Tasks

### 1. Response Data Structures
- Create `mcp_response_types.py` module with response dataclasses:
  - `SearchResponse` - structured search results with metadata
  - `IndexResponse` - indexing operation results
  - `StatusResponse` - index status and health information
- Add JSON serialization methods for all response types

### 2. Enhanced Search Tool
- Create new structured search tool alongside existing string-based tool
- Return comprehensive search metadata:
  - Query analysis and suggestions
  - Confidence distribution across results
  - Language breakdown of results
  - Execution timing and performance metrics
- Include suggested query refinements based on results

### 3. Backward Compatibility Layer
- Maintain existing MCP tools for users who depend on string output
- Add new `_structured` variants of existing tools
- Implement automatic fallback to string format when needed
- Provide clear tool descriptions for both formats

### 4. Response Enhancement Features
- Add search result clustering to group related findings
- Include cross-references between related code constructs
- Provide confidence scoring and relevance explanations
- Add navigation hints for IDE integration

## Success Criteria
- [ ] New structured MCP tools return properly formatted JSON responses
- [ ] Existing string-based tools continue to work unchanged
- [ ] Search responses include rich metadata and suggestions
- [ ] Claude can process structured responses effectively
- [ ] Response format is well-documented and consistent

## Files to Create/Modify
- `mcp_response_types.py` - New module for response data structures
- `mcp_server.py` - Add structured tool variants
- `search_operations.py` - Enhance search to provide metadata
- `tests/test_mcp_responses.py` - Test structured responses

## Dependencies
- Step 000007 must be completed (code constructs available)
- Step 000005 must be completed (search result structures)

## Technical Notes
- Use dataclasses with `asdict()` for clean JSON serialization
- Design response schemas to be extensible without breaking changes
- Include version information in responses for future compatibility
- Consider using JSON Schema for response validation

## Proposed Solution

I will implement structured MCP tool responses through the following approach:

1. **Create mcp_response_types.py module**: Define comprehensive dataclasses for SearchResponse, IndexResponse, and StatusResponse with JSON serialization methods using `asdict()`.

2. **Add structured search tool variants**: Create new MCP tools with `_structured` suffix that return JSON responses instead of formatted strings, while keeping existing tools for backward compatibility.

3. **Enhance search operations**: Extend search_operations.py to provide rich metadata including:
   - Query analysis with confidence scoring
   - Result clustering by language/file type
   - Cross-references between related code constructs
   - Performance metrics and execution timing
   - Suggested query refinements

4. **Implement response enhancement features**: Add result clustering, confidence explanations, and navigation hints for IDE integration.

5. **Create comprehensive tests**: Test structured responses, JSON serialization, backward compatibility, and all enhanced metadata features.

The implementation will leverage the existing CodeSearchResult and SearchMetadata classes from search_result_types.py while adding new response wrappers specifically for MCP tools.
