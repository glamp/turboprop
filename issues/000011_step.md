# Step 000011: Advanced Result Ranking and Confidence Scoring

## Overview
Implement sophisticated result ranking algorithms and confidence scoring to improve search result quality and provide transparency in result relevance.

## Context
With rich metadata now available, we can implement intelligent ranking that considers multiple factors beyond just embedding similarity, providing better results and confidence indicators for AI agents.

## Implementation Tasks

### 1. Multi-Factor Ranking Algorithm
- Create `result_ranking.py` module
- Implement composite scoring that considers:
  - Embedding similarity (base score)
  - File type relevance (prefer source code over docs for code queries)
  - Construct type matching (functions for function queries)
  - File size and complexity (balance detail vs. relevance)
  - Git recency (more recently modified files score higher)

### 2. Confidence Level Classification
- Implement confidence scoring: 'high', 'medium', 'low'
- Base confidence on multiple factors:
  - Embedding similarity threshold
  - Query-result type alignment
  - Construct completeness (full function vs. snippet)
  - Cross-validation with similar results

### 3. Match Reason Generation
- Implement explainable search results
- Generate human-readable reasons for why results match:
  - "Function signature matches query pattern"
  - "Docstring contains relevant keywords"
  - "File contains imported libraries mentioned in query"
  - "Similar code patterns found in same file"

### 4. Result Clustering and Deduplication
- Group similar results from the same file or related files
- Identify and merge duplicate or near-duplicate results
- Implement result diversity to avoid showing too many similar matches
- Add cross-reference detection between related code constructs

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Search results are ranked by composite relevance, not just similarity
- [ ] Each result includes a confidence level (high/medium/low)
- [ ] Results include human-readable explanations for why they match
- [ ] Similar results are properly clustered and deduplicated
- [ ] Result quality is noticeably improved compared to simple similarity ranking

## Files to Create/Modify
- `result_ranking.py` - New module for advanced ranking and scoring
- `search_operations.py` - Integrate advanced ranking into search
- `search_result_types.py` - Add confidence and reasoning fields
- `tests/test_result_ranking.py` - Test ranking algorithm effectiveness

## Dependencies
- Step 000010 must be completed (repository context available)

## Technical Notes
- Use weighted combination of multiple relevance signals
- Consider implementing machine learning-based ranking in future iterations
- Balance ranking sophistication with search performance
- Design ranking to be configurable and tunable
