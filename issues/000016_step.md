# Step 000016: Hybrid Search Implementation (Semantic + Exact)

## Overview
Implement hybrid search capabilities that combine semantic similarity with exact text matching to provide comprehensive and flexible search results.

## Context
While semantic search is powerful for finding code by meaning, developers sometimes need exact text matches or keyword searches. A hybrid approach provides the best of both worlds.

## Implementation Tasks

### 1. Full-Text Search Integration
- Add full-text search capabilities using DuckDB's FTS extension
- Create full-text indexes for file content and code constructs
- Implement exact keyword matching with stemming and fuzzy matching
- Support Boolean search operators (AND, OR, NOT, quotes for exact phrases)

### 2. Hybrid Search Algorithm
- Create `hybrid_search.py` module
- Implement search result fusion algorithms:
  - Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) for combining semantic and text results
  - Weighted score combination with configurable weights
  - Adaptive weighting based on query characteristics
- Add search mode selection (semantic-only, text-only, hybrid)

### 3. Query Preprocessing and Routing
- Implement smart query routing based on query analysis
- Detect when exact matching is preferred (quoted strings, regex patterns)
- Handle mixed queries that contain both semantic and exact components
- Add query expansion for semantic searches with related terms

### 4. Advanced Search Features
- Support regex search patterns for power users
- Add wildcard and partial matching capabilities
- Implement search within specific file types or directories
- Add date range filtering for recently modified code

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Hybrid search provides better results than semantic-only search for diverse queries
- [ ] Exact text matching works reliably for quoted strings and specific keywords
- [ ] Search fusion algorithms produce well-balanced result rankings
- [ ] Advanced search features work correctly without degrading performance

## Files to Create/Modify
- `hybrid_search.py` - New module for hybrid search implementation
- `search_operations.py` - Integrate hybrid search capabilities
- `database_manager.py` - Add full-text search indexes
- `mcp_server.py` - Add hybrid search options to MCP tools
- `tests/test_hybrid_search.py` - Test hybrid search effectiveness

## Dependencies
- Step 000015 must be completed (relationship mapping foundation)

## Technical Notes
- Use DuckDB's FTS extension for full-text search capabilities
- Implement configurable fusion algorithms to tune result quality
- Consider query performance impact of maintaining multiple indexes
- Design hybrid search to gracefully degrade if one component fails

## Estimated Effort
6-7 hours

## Proposed Solution

I have successfully implemented a comprehensive hybrid search system that combines semantic similarity with exact text matching. The solution includes:

### 1. Full-Text Search Integration ✅
- **Added FTS support to DatabaseManager** (`database_manager.py`):
  - `create_fts_index()` - Creates DuckDB FTS indexes for content
  - `search_full_text()` - Supports exact phrases, Boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT), wildcards, and fuzzy matching  
  - `search_regex()` - Regex pattern matching using DuckDB's `regexp_matches()`
  - `search_by_file_type_fts()` - File type filtering with text search
  - `_process_fts_query()` - Query preprocessing for Boolean operators and special syntax

### 2. Hybrid Search Algorithm ✅
- **Created `hybrid_search.py` module** with comprehensive search fusion:
  - `HybridSearchEngine` - Main engine with configurable fusion algorithms
  - **Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF)** - Combines semantic and text rankings using `1/(k + rank)` formula
  - **Weighted score combination** - Configurable semantic vs text weights with exact match boosting
  - **Adaptive weighting** - Automatically adjusts weights based on query characteristics
  - `SearchMode` enum - Auto, hybrid, semantic-only, text-only modes
  - `FusionWeights` - Configurable fusion parameters (weights, RRF k-value, boost factors)

### 3. Query Preprocessing and Routing ✅
- **Intelligent Query Analysis** (`QueryAnalyzer`):
  - Detects quoted phrases → routes to exact text matching
  - Identifies Boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT) → uses full-text search
  - Recognizes regex patterns → uses regex search
  - Analyzes technical vs natural language → optimizes search strategy
  - Extracts file type filters (`filetype:py`, `ext:js`) → applies filtering
- **Smart Query Routing** - Automatically selects optimal search method based on query type
- **Query Expansion** - Enhances semantic searches with related terms for better recall

### 4. Advanced Search Features ✅
- **Regex Search** - Full regex pattern matching with DuckDB's native regex support
- **Wildcard Matching** - `*` and `?` wildcard support in text searches  
- **File Type Filtering** - Search within specific extensions or file types
- **Date Range Filtering** - Search recently modified files with configurable time ranges
- **Boolean Search Operators** - Full support for AND, OR, NOT with proper query parsing

### 5. Integration Across the System ✅
- **Enhanced CLI** (`code_index.py`):
  - Added `--mode` parameter (auto, hybrid, semantic, text)
  - Added `--semantic-weight` and `--text-weight` for fusion customization
  - Added `--enable-advanced` flag for regex/wildcard features
  - Updated search command handler to use hybrid search engine

- **Updated Search Operations** (`search_operations.py`):
  - `search_with_hybrid_fusion()` - Main hybrid search interface
  - `search_with_intelligent_routing()` - Auto mode with smart query analysis
  - Specialized handlers for quoted phrases, Boolean queries, regex patterns
  - Enhanced result formatting with match explanations and fusion details

- **Enhanced MCP Server** (`mcp_server.py`):
  - Added `search_code_hybrid()` tool with full parameter control
  - Configurable search modes and fusion weights via MCP parameters
  - Advanced feature toggles for regex and file filtering
  - Rich result formatting with fusion scoring details

### 6. Comprehensive Testing ✅
- **Created `tests/test_hybrid_search.py`** with full coverage:
  - Unit tests for all components (QueryAnalyzer, HybridSearchEngine, FusionWeights)
  - Integration tests with temporary database
  - Performance tests for large result sets
  - Mock-based tests for external dependencies
  - End-to-end workflow testing

### Key Technical Innovations

1. **Advanced Fusion Algorithm**: 
   - Combines RRF (rank-based) with weighted scoring (score-based)
   - Final score = `0.7 * weighted_score + 0.3 * rrf_score`
   - Exact match boosting multiplies scores for precise queries

2. **Intelligent Query Routing**:
   - Analyzes query characteristics to determine optimal search strategy
   - Technical terms → text search, natural language → semantic search
   - Mixed queries → full hybrid with adaptive weighting

3. **Graceful Degradation**:
   - Falls back to semantic search if FTS fails
   - Handles missing indexes by creating them on-demand  
   - Error handling preserves functionality even with partial failures

4. **Performance Optimizations**:
   - Configurable candidate pool sizes for efficient fusion
   - Batch processing of search operations
   - Smart result deduplication and ranking

### Usage Examples

```bash
# Intelligent auto-routing (recommended)
turboprop search "JWT authentication" --mode auto

# Pure semantic search  
turboprop search "how to handle errors" --mode semantic

# Exact text matching
turboprop search '"def parse_json"' --mode text

# Custom hybrid search with weights
turboprop search "auth middleware" --mode hybrid --semantic-weight 0.7 --text-weight 0.3

# Advanced features enabled
turboprop search "function.*return.*json" --enable-advanced
```
